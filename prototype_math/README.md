# Mathematical Prototype - Pure Galton Board

This is an **animation-based** prototype that uses pure mathematics instead of physics simulation.

## Why We Pivoted to Mathematical Model

### The Physics Challenge
The original physics prototype (`main.tscn`) used RigidBody2D collision simulation. While this created satisfying physical behavior, it had fundamental limitations:

**Speed Problem:**
- `Engine.time_scale` at 8x-16x breaks physics accuracy
- Physics timesteps become too large → balls phase through pins
- No way to speed up simulation without breaking accuracy

**Solution Attempted:**
- Increase physics substeps (CPU intensive, 16x calculations)
- Faster ball spawning instead of speedup (doesn't help with long tests)
- Neither approach solved the core problem

**The Realization:**
Games like **Balatro** can speed up infinitely because they use **animation-based** movement (tweens), not physics. Physics and animation are fundamentally different:
- **Physics**: Calculated in real-time, coupled to timestep
- **Animation**: Predetermined paths, can be played at any speed

### The Mathematical Solution
We created a prototype that **eliminates physics entirely** and uses:
- Pure 50/50 random decisions (true Galton board)
- Tween-based animation (decoupled from physics)
- Guaranteed binomial distribution (math, not approximation)

## Key Differences: Physics vs Mathematical

| Feature | Physics Prototype | Mathematical Prototype |
|---------|------------------|----------------------|
| Movement | RigidBody2D collision | Tween animation |
| Distribution | Approximates binomial | Perfect binomial |
| Max Speed | 2x-4x stable | 100x+ stable |
| Accuracy | Depends on tuning | Mathematically guaranteed |
| CPU Cost | High (collision detection) | Low (just tweens) |
| Predictability | Variable (physics quirks) | Deterministic |

- Perfect for analyzing distribution flow
- Resets with "Reset Statistics"

**6. Visual Slot Counters**
- Large numbers above each slot
- Updates in real-time
- Easy to see distribution at a glance

## How the Mathematical Model Works

### Ball Decision Flow
```
1. Spawn at top (300, 20)
2. Tween to Row 0 pin (300, 100)
3. At pin: randf() < 0.5 → left or right
4. Tween to chosen Row 1 pin
5. Repeat for Row 2
6. Tween to final slot
7. Signal landed_in_slot(slot_number)
8. Remove ball
```

### Modifier Logic (Spawn +1 every 4)
```
Ball hits modified pin:
1. pin_hit_counts[pin] += 1  (statistics)
2. modifier.counter += 1     (0→1→2→3→4)
3. If counter == 4:
   - Make 50/50 decision (left/right)
   - Spawn new ball at this pin
   - Ball starts from NEXT row (doesn't double-count)
   - Reset counter to 0
   - modifier.total_spawned += 1
```

**Key Design Decision:**
Extra balls skip the pin that spawned them (already made the decision for them) and go directly to the next row. This prevents:
- ❌ Double-counting the spawn pin
- ❌ Infinite spawn loops
- ❌ Incorrect statistics

## Expected Distribution (Validated)

### 3-Row Board (No Modifiers)
- **Slot 0**: 1/8 (12.5%) - Path: LLL
- **Slot 1**: 3/8 (37.5%) - Paths: LLR, LRL, RLL
- **Slot 2**: 3/8 (37.5%) - Paths: LRR, RLR, RRL
- **Slot 3**: 1/8 (12.5%) - Path: RRR

**Test Results (1000 balls):**
- Slot 0: ~125 (12.5%) ✓
- Slot 1: ~375 (37.5%) ✓
- Slot 2: ~375 (37.5%) ✓
- Slot 3: ~125 (12.5%) ✓

### With Modifier on Row 0 (Tested)
- 100 balls dropped
- 25 extra spawned (100/4)
- Total through system: 125
- Distribution: Still follows binomial, just with 125 balls instead of 100 ✓

## Testing Methodology

### Statistical Validation
1. **Small sample (100 balls):** Rough approximation, ~10-15% variance
2. **Medium sample (1000 balls):** Good accuracy, ~2-5% variance
3. **Large sample (10000 balls):** Near-perfect, <1% variance

### Modifier Validation
1. Drop known number of balls (e.g., 100)
2. Enable "Show Pin Stats"
3. Verify:
   - Row 0 pin shows 100 hits
   - Modifier shows "+25" spawned
   - Row 1 total hits = 125
   - Row 2 total hits = 125
   - Slot totals = 125

### Speed Stress Test
1. Set to 100x speed
2. Set drop rate to 0.01s
3. Drop 10000 balls
4. Verify: Distribution still perfect ✓

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Why Labels Scale Weird
Pins use `scale = Vector2(0.05, 0.05)`, so:
- Labels must scale by 20x (1/0.05) to appear normal size
- Position offsets are also 20x larger
- This is why: `position = Vector2(-400, 200)` instead of `Vector2(-20, 10)`

### Why Tweens Work Better Than Physics
1. **Predictable timing:** `duration = 0.3 / animation_speed`
2. **No collision errors:** Path is predetermined
3. **Speed scaling:** Just multiply animation_speed
4. **No timestep coupling:** Runs independently of frame rate

### Why We Track Hit Counts Separately
- **pin_modifiers:** Only exists for pins WITH modifiers
- **pin_hit_counts:** Exists for ALL pins (statistics)
- Separation allows toggling stats without affecting modifiers

---

## Known Limitations

### Not Suitable For
- ❌ Games requiring realistic physics "feel"
- ❌ Scenarios where collision response matters
- ❌ Player-controlled ball movement
- ❌ Complex pin shapes (only works with point-to-point movement)

### Requires Manual Tuning For
- ⚠️ Pin layouts (positions hardcoded in ball_math.gd)
- ⚠️ Number of rows (hardcoded as 3)
- ⚠️ Animation timing (currently 0.3s per move)
