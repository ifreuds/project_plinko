# Plinko War - Prototype v0.1 Plan
Engine: Godot 4.5
Goal: Validate core loop and physics - "Does the Plinko board behave as expected mathematically?"

---

## âœ… PROTOTYPE v0.1 COMPLETED & VALIDATED

### STATUS: Physics validation successful! Distribution matches expected binomial curve.

**Test Results (532 balls):**
- Center slots (3+4): 53.2% (expected 54.6%) âœ“
- Edge slots (0+7): 4.1% (expected 1.6%) - Acceptable variance
- Bell curve shape preserved with proper gradients
- No systematic left/right bias

### âœ… ALL FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:

1. **Core Systems**
   - âœ… 7-row triangle pin layout (28 pins total)
   - âœ… 8 scoring slots with Area2D detection
   - âœ… Ball spawning system with RigidBody2D
   - âœ… Statistics UI showing expected vs actual distribution
   - âœ… Reset and drop controls working
   - âœ… Side walls to contain balls
   - âœ… Collision layer system (balls pass through each other)

2. **Scenes Created**
   - âœ… ball.tscn - Ball with proper collision setup
   - âœ… pin.tscn - Static pins with physics material
   - âœ… scoring_slot.tscn - Detection zones
   - âœ… main.tscn - Complete game board

3. **Scripts Implemented**
   - âœ… ball.gd - Ball lifecycle and removal
   - âœ… pin.gd - Pin placeholder (no special behavior needed)
   - âœ… scoring_slot.gd - Ball detection and counting
   - âœ… game_manager.gd - Ball spawning, statistics, UI updates
   - âœ… ui.gd - Statistics display with heatmap colors

### âœ… PHYSICS CALIBRATION COMPLETED

**Final Validated Parameters:**
- **Friction**: 0.40 (Ball & Pin both)
- **Bounce**: 0.28 (Ball & Pin both)
- **Gravity scale**: 0.5
- **Linear damp**: 1.1
- **Angular damp**: 2.0
- **Initial velocity**: randf_range(-18.0, 18.0) horizontal

**Calibration Journey:**
1. Started with inverted distribution (edge-clustering)
2. Discovered "deflection ratcheting" (velocity accumulation)
3. Applied high damping â†’ achieved bell curve but over-compressed
4. Iteratively reduced damping with micro-adjustments
5. Final result: Proper binomial distribution within acceptable tolerances

**Key Lesson:** Iterative micro-adjustments (Â±0.1-0.2 changes) more effective than large parameter swings.

### ðŸ“‹ KNOWN LIMITATIONS (For Future Phases):
1. **Stuck balls** - Rare edge case (~1/500-1000) where ball balances on pin top
2. **Simulation speed** - 500+ ball tests take considerable time (physics calculation intensive)
3. **Edge slot variance** - Slightly higher than theoretical (2-4x vs 1x) but within acceptable range for gameplay

### ðŸŽ¯ NEXT PHASE (v0.2 - Gameplay Prototype):
- Add actual scoring system with point values per slot
- Implement basic unit types with different physics properties
- Add turn/round structure
- Optimize simulation speed (time scale, batching, instant simulation option)
- Fix stuck ball edge case (detection + gentle nudge)

## What We're Building (Minimum Viable Prototype)

A testing environment where:
1. Balls drop from the top in a 7-row triangle board
2. Balls bounce off static pins
3. Balls land in 8 scoring slots at the bottom
4. Statistics track distribution to validate physics against probability model

What's NOT in this prototype:
- No unit types yet (just one standard ball)
- No special pins (just basic collision pins)
- No enemies or rounds
- No progression or unlocks
- No scoring system (just counting and statistics)

## Core Features to Implement

### 1. Basic Scene Setup
- Create a 2D scene (game board)
- Set up camera to view the entire board
- Define play area boundaries

### 2. Pin System (7-Row Triangle)
- Create pin objects (static circles/pegs)
- Arrange pins in triangle pattern:
  - Row 1: 1 pin
  - Row 2: 2 pins
  - Row 3: 3 pins
  - Row 4: 4 pins
  - Row 5: 5 pins
  - Row 6: 6 pins
  - Row 7: 7 pins
- Pins should be StaticBody2D with CircleShape2D collision
- Pins have physics material for bounce

### 3. Ball Physics
- Create ball object (RigidBody2D with CircleShape2D)
- Ball spawns at top center of board
- Ball affected by gravity
- Ball bounces off pins (physics material with bounce property)
- Ball has slight randomness in initial drop angle
- Ball is removed from scene after landing in slot

### 4. Scoring Slots (8 slots at bottom)
- Create 8 slots numbered 0-7 from left to right
- Each slot is an Area2D that detects ball entry
- When ball enters slot, increment that slot's counter
- Ball is removed after being counted

### 5. Testing Interface UI
- Input field: Set number of balls to drop (default: 128)
- "Drop Balls" button: Automatically spawns and drops all balls in sequence
- "Reset Counters" button: Clear all statistics and start fresh
- "Fast Forward" toggle: Speed up physics simulation (optional for v0.1)
- Total balls dropped counter

### 6. Per-Slot Statistics Display
Each of the 8 slots displays:
- Slot number (0-7)
- Expected probability as fraction (e.g., "35/128")
- Expected percentage (e.g., "27.34%")
- Actual ball count (e.g., "Balls: 34")
- Actual percentage based on total balls dropped (e.g., "Actual: 26.5%")
- Visual indicator: Background color intensity based on ball count (heatmap)

### 7. Expected Probability Reference
Display somewhere on screen:
- Slot 0: 1/128 (0.78%)
- Slot 1: 7/128 (5.47%)
- Slot 2: 21/128 (16.41%)
- Slot 3: 35/128 (27.34%)
- Slot 4: 35/128 (27.34%)
- Slot 5: 21/128 (16.41%)
- Slot 6: 7/128 (5.47%)
- Slot 7: 1/128 (0.78%)

## Technical Requirements

### Physics Settings (OUTDATED - See Current Status Above):
**ORIGINAL ESTIMATES (TOO HIGH - CAUSED INVERTED DISTRIBUTION):**
- Gravity: Adjust to feel good (start with default)
- Ball bounce: 0.5-0.8 (needs testing)
- Ball friction: 0.1-0.3 (needs testing)
- Pin friction: 0.2 (needs testing)
- Pin bounce: 0.3-0.5 (needs testing)

**ACTUAL WORKING RANGE (After Research & Testing):**
- Gravity: 0.5 (much slower than default)
- Ball bounce: 0.05-1.0 (actively tuning - needs to be LOW)
- Ball friction: 0.9 (much higher than initial estimate)
- Pin friction: 0.9 (much higher than initial estimate)
- Pin bounce: 0.05-0.15 (much lower than initial estimate)

Key lesson: Galton boards need MUCH slower physics than typical games!

### Key Godot Nodes:
- Ball: RigidBody2D + CircleShape2D + Sprite2D
- Pin: StaticBody2D + CircleShape2D + Sprite2D
- Scoring Slot: Area2D + CollisionShape2D + Label
- UI: CanvasLayer + VBoxContainer (for controls) + Labels (for stats)

### Scripts Needed:
1. ball.gd - Ball physics and behavior
2. scoring_slot.gd - Detect ball entry, increment counter, emit signal
3. game_manager.gd - Spawn balls, track total statistics, reset counters
4. slot_display.gd - Update slot UI with count and percentages

## Success Criteria

Physics and probability model is validated if:
- After dropping 128+ balls, distribution roughly matches expected probabilities (within Â±3%)
- Center slots (3 & 4) consistently get most balls (~54% combined)
- Edge slots (0 & 7) rarely get balls (<1% each)
- No systematic bias to left or right side
- Ball behavior feels satisfying (not too floaty, not too rigid)

Red flags to watch for:
- Ball gets stuck on pins
- Ball passes through pins (collision issues)
- Distribution heavily skewed from expected probabilities
- Balls behave too randomly or too deterministically

## Iteration Questions After v0.1

After building and testing this, we'll answer:
1. Does the probability distribution match theory?
2. Does the ball drop feel satisfying to watch?
3. Is the bounce behavior predictable enough for future strategy?
4. Do we need to adjust pin spacing or board size?
5. What physics settings give the best feel?
6. Is 7 rows the right amount, or should we test 5 or 9 rows?

## Next Steps After Prototype v0.1

Once v0.1 works and validates physics:
1. Add ability to manually place/move pins before dropping balls
2. Implement actual scoring system (slots have point values)
3. Design 3 unit types with different physics properties
4. Design 5 pin types with special effects
5. Create one enemy with specific scoring rules
6. Build one complete round flow
